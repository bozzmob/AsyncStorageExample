#Trying Example from react-native-store

Earlier plan was to implement a simple example based on AsyncStorage API of react-native.
But, [react-native-store](https://github.com/thewei/react-native-store) project looks promising and way more functional, modular and awesome. Thanks to @thewei.

react-native-store is a simple database base on react-native AsyncStorage.
